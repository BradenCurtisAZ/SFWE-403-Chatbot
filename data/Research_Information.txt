Research Opportunities and Information for Software Engineering Majors at the University of Arizona:

Ongoing research at the University of Arizona involving software engineering includes:
Autonomous systems and robotics
Communications, coding and information theory
Computer architecture and cloud/distributed computing
Data analytics, informatics and machine learning
Embedded systems
Wireless networking, security and systems

There are also opportunities with the Systems & Industrial Engineering (SIE) department.
Partnering with the Arizona Department of Transportation, renowned researchers in SIE are developing 
technology for connected vehicles and making emergency response quicker. Working closely with 
the Department of Homeland Security and the National Center for Border Security and Immigration, 
they are creating an autonomous surveillance system to help secure the U.S.-Mexico border. 
And, cooperating with Air Force Research Laboratory and an international alliance, they are 
developing a cyberinfrastructure to monitor satellites and manage traffic in space.

SIE's focus areas include:
Data Analytics, Informatics and Machine Learning
Energy, Water, Environment and Sustainability
Health Care Systems
Human Factors and Sociotechnical Systems
Optimization
Smart Transportation and Manufacturing Logistics
Software Engineering
Space, Defense and Security

Much of SIE’s transportation engineering research takes place at the UA’s interdisciplinary 
Transportation Research Institute, which addresses the mobility, safety and environmental 
challenges of a rapidly evolving transportation ecosystem.
Further facilitating SIE discovery are a number of multidisciplinary labs, including the 
Space Systems Engineering Lab, which is supporting to the OSIRIS-REx Asteroid Sample Return 
Mission in the Lunar & Planetary Laboratory.
