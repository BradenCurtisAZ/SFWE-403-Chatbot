Selecting Desired Major:
NetID Login Required

*Important note: All students must have a UA cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 to be eligible to change degree programs or move into the College of Engineering. Strong grades in required math, science and engineering classes are good indicators of success in all of our degree programs. You can be denied even if you meet the GPA requirements for the chosen degree program if your math, science and engineering classes are not sufficiently strong.

You must be a continuing UA student to use this form. If you are a new, prospective or incoming transfer or freshman student, please visit our new student admission webpage for academic requirements. You must have completed at least 12 UA engineering degree required units to be considered for admission to an Engineering major. Grades of D or E, or repeated use of GROâ€™s in math/science/engineering classes will diminish your chances for admission.

Include only grades for classes taken at the University of Arizona. Do not include transfer courses.
