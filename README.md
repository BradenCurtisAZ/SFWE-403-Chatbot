# ChatCat

As part of a class, this AI chatbot site was created to serve people interested in the Software Engineering program at the University of Arizona.

To run this site, you will need an extension called "LiveServer" found here -> https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
    
- While focused on the index.html file, click the button in the bottom right that says "Go Live".        
- This will open the page in your default browser.
- That's it! Start asking the AI questions!
